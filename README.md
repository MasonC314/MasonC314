- 👋 Hi, I’m @MasonC314
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code on a professional level, and perhaps finding a tutor or mentor to help me learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various beginner/entry-level coding principles, through freeCodeCamp.org.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything that would give me a good opportunity to learn and build my base of knowledge, without just being thrown into the deep end.
- 📫 I can be reached through my email: macarbajal0503@gmail.com
